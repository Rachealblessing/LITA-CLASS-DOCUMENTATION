### project overview
Data analysis is the process of examining, cleaning, and interpreting data to extract useful insights and support decision-making. It involves collecting data from various sources, cleaning it to ensure accuracy, and then using techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. Advanced methods, such as statistical analysis and machine learning, can then be applied for deeper insights. Overall, data analysis is essential in various fields to help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

### Data sources
---
The primary source of data used is from Kaggle, which is a great platform that offers a wide variety of datasets across different domains. Itâ€™s a valuable resource for data analysis projects, providing access to real-world data and allowing me to explore various data science techniques.

### Tools used

### Data cleaning and preparations
---
1. data loading and inspection
2. handling missing variables
3. data cleaning and formatting
   

### Exploratory data analysis
---
EDA is essential for gaining insights into the data before applying more complex statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.
- Exploratory Data Analysis summarize the main characteristics of a dataset through descriptive statistics.
- It visualizes data patterns and relationships using various charts and graphs.
- what are the overall sales trend?
- what product are the top sellers?
